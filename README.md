# PtitPrince

A python implementation of the Raincloud plot!


You can install it via
```
pip install ptitprince
```

or cloning this repo in your working directory.

 I tried to port to python the Raincloud plot (or PetitPrince plot, depending on the orientation) from R (under ggplot2) to Python.  The Raincloud plot is a variant of the violin plot written in R ggplot2 by [Micah Allen](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/). Everithing started with  this xkcd comic, making fun of the violin plot.

I found a [tweet](https://twitter.com/flxrue/status/974639616912478210) asking for a .py version, and I agreed. Alas, the py version for ggplot2 does not allow to create new styles in a confortable way. So I decided to use the [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) library and to rewrite a bit the `violin_plot` function. [This](half_viol.py) is the rewitten version.

Then I tried to replicate the plots from the original post by [Micah Allen](https://micahallen.org/2018/03/15/introducing-raincloud-plots/), using Jupyter.

## Plans for the future:

 * ask seaborn mantainers to add this new plot type
 * add a "move" option in seabon to control the positioning of each plot, as in ggplot2.
